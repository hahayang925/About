## About me

I worked as a bank teller for more than two years, and I found no achievement and excitement in my job. I encounter Front End Developement accidentally and it was so challenging and interesting to me. Therefore, I transfer from a bank teller to a Front End Developer.

Personal characteristic:
* I love to study new techniques, and keep improving myself.
* I am able to communicate and collaborate with team members.
